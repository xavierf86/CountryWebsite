            <p>Before the Spanish arrived, Chile was home to many indigenous groups. The biggest group was the Mapuche, who lived in the southern and the center part of Chile. They were skilled farmers and fighters who protected their land for hundreds of years. There are also other groups, like the Acatameno and Aymara who lived in the Northen desert part of Chile. These civilizations developed their own languages and traditions, long before Europeans came there.</p>

            <h2>Spanish Colonization</h2>
            <p class="history-text">In the 1500s, Spanish explorers arrived, and tried to take control of Chile. The Mapuche however,  resisted strongly, leading to one of the longest conflicts in South Americas history. Even though Spain would eventually controll most of the land, the Mapuche kept on fighting to protect their territory. While Chile was under colonial rule by Spain, they built cities, spreaded Christianity, and created a new social system.</p>

            <p>By the early 1800s, many Chileans wanted freedom from Spain, Leaders like Bernardo O'Higgins, and Jose de San Martin were the ones that led their independence movement. After several battles, Chile officially broke away from Spanish rule, and became independent in 1818. Independence allowed the country to start building their own government and economy. </p>

            <h2>Present Day Chile</h2>
            <p class="history-text">After independence, Chile faced many new changes, including economic growth, new laws, and political changes. In the 1900s, the country went through hard times, including a military dictatorship, from 1973 to 1990. Today, Chile is a democratic country that continues growing and improving. Their history shows us how Chileans stayed strong through challenges and changes.</p>
