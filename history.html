            <p>Chile was first homed to indigenous groups, which was before they were taken over by the Spanish in the 1500s. After many years of conflict and changes in leadership, Chile would soon gain their independence in 1818. After this, the country would soon go on with many political challenges, economic growth, and changes in the government. Chile has faced many challenges throughout its history, but still continues to grow and change the country it is today.</p>
